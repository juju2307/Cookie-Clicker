# Cookie-Clicker "Pierre Lapin"

## Product Description
Creation of a group cookie-clicker game (Elisandre, Adrien, Gaelle and Julie) during our webdev training at BeCode. The user must click on Peter Rabbit's head to make him eat carrots and collect poo. The more droppings the user collects, the more possibilities he has to make purchases.
50 clicks = possibility to use the "Multiplier"
250 clicks = possibility to use "Auto-click"
